At the start of 2025, I began my journey with learning tech, learning through the usual web development pathways.
I picked up HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and a couple frameworks along the way like React and Django. 

Along my learning journey, I became more interested in the security side, and began following a learning path for red teaming.

## Write-Ups

I've often heard, such as from the Feynman Technique, that teaching someone else is a good test of understanding. 
While write-ups do not precisely count as teaching, and capture-the-flag machines are not representative of real-life red team activities, writing these reports nonetheless is my effort at deepening my understanding and documenting my learning.

With the wealth of resources out there, Hack The Box appealed to me due to its variety and ease of entry. Currently, I am following the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/pubhtml#" target="_blank">list of PEN-200-like machines</a>, maintained by TJNull.
