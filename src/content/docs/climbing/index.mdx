## About My Climbing

I've been rock climbing since 2017! I quickly took to bouldering, and am mainly inspired by outdoor projects.
This section of my stuff is part session blog and part climbing notes.

This might be a bit of an unconventional way to document my climbing, but structure leads to consistency, leads to progress (at least for me). 
The hope is that this documentation process leads to better analysis and understanding for my own climbing.

Besides, as a piece of media, it will be cool to look back upon as I work and (hopefully!) finish new things.
