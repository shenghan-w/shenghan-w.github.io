## Current Sequence

### Setup
Pads should get pushed back to prevent possibility of dabbing. 
Plug left knee bar (more of a knee scum), and get as far under the boulder as possible.

### First Half
<Steps>

1. Right hand thrutch with knee-bar already in.
2. Left hand up to slot - the thumb catch is the key bit of the hold.
3. Set right heel hook, get the right hand crimp.
4. Set left heel hook, bump left hand up to pinch.
5. Walk to get right toe on crimp, powerful right hand move to good hold.

</Steps>

	This is the end of the physical crux, though it is by no means over.
</Aside>

### Second Half
<Steps>
6. Left heel, bump left hand up.
7. Bump left heel, left hand bumps over the lip.
8. Right toe goes up to crack, left hand bumps to better edge.
9. Right toe in, left switches to toe-hook, right hand bump sequence along good holds to the top jug.
10. Right foot up to edge, throw left heel hook far up and back.
11. Left hand bump sequence, all the way up to the block.
12. Right foot blind step up to a good ledge, left foot steps in.
13. Right toe-hook matches the right hand, and the right hand crosses up and over the left hand to a good seam.
14. Stood up onto the face, and from there, it's a juggy top out.

</ Steps>

## Sessions

### Session 4 - October 10, 2025

Some good progress, but a bit frustrated to never stick the 5th move from the start. 
This would represent doing all of the physical part of the climbing, and from there, sending would require mostly execution and power endurance.

Did stick the 5th move once, but right foot floated off and dabbed on the pads.
- More learning to be done in terms of pulling well with the right toe.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 3 through getting ready for the top sequence
- From start through move 5 (ish)

### Session 3 - October 3rd, 2025

Hot session with slick conditions. No significant progress, but tried and decided on various foot positions:
- Decided on heel positions after the 5th move, as well as right foot positions to oppose the heels.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 5 to the lip
- Lip encounter to the top

### Session 2 - September 28th, 2025

Did the 3rd move! Psyched on the climb again.

#### Some key beta for the 3rd move:
- Instinct laces were the best heels.
- 3 finger drag with a thumb-catch for the left hand.
- Left wrist sits to the right side of the bump.
- Left knee points slightly towards the target right hand.
- Left hand only pulls enough to set the heel.
- The right heel pulls as hard as possible.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 3-5
- Start through move 3
- Lip encounter to the topout (poor beta, needed refining)

### Session 1 - 2024

Quickly did all the moves, except for the third. The 5th move took several tries, but did it a few times that session.

Spent probably 2+ hours on just the third move, and never stuck it. Could never decide how exactly to hold the left hand slot.
