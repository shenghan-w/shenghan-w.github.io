import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## General Notes

- Rock: Crisp granite block in the Wild Basin sector of Rocky Mountain National Park
- Style and Movement: Compression and power endurance
- Hold selection: Generally open hand and comfortable. One half-pad right hand crimp for the crux move, and one sharp crimp over the lip for left hand
- Other Notes: None

## Current Sequence

### Setup
Pads should get pushed back to prevent possibility of dabbing. 
Plug left knee bar (more of a knee scum), and get as far under the boulder as possible.

### First Half
<Steps>

1. Right hand thrutch with knee-bar already in.
2. Left hand up to slot - the thumb catch is the key bit of the hold.
3. Set right heel hook, get the right hand crimp.
4. Set left heel hook, bump left hand up to pinch.
5. Walk to get right toe on crimp, powerful right hand move to good hold.

</Steps>

	This is the end of the physical crux, though it is by no means over.
</Aside>

### Second Half
<Steps>
6. Left heel, bump left hand up.
7. Bump left heel, left hand bumps over the lip.
8. Right toe goes up to crack, left hand bumps to better edge.
9. Right toe in, left switches to toe-hook, right hand bump sequence along good holds to the top jug.
10. Right foot up to edge, throw left heel hook far up and back.
11. Left hand bump sequence, all the way up to the block.
12. Right foot blind step up to a good ledge, left foot steps in.
13. Right toe-hook matches the right hand, and the right hand crosses up and over the left hand to a good seam.
14. Stood up onto the face, and from there, it's a juggy top out.

</ Steps>

## Sessions

### Session 6 - October 25th, 2025

Much better session. Tried a new right hand target for the crux 5th move, but it felt less aligned to how I do the move, so decided to keep original beta.\
Had one good burn, falling because the high heel over the lip wasn't placed well. In general, reaching the 5th move I felt more fresh.
Left arm felt incredibly burnt out by the time I reached the lip, and left bicep feels like it needs more endurance in order to make it to the top. 
Could try to figure out a footwalk as well, for placing the right foot.

3rd move beta:
- A little momentum is still needed, I can't do the move static
- Changing shoes didn't matter that much

#### Significant Links:
- Had one go from start, to falling from swinging the heel over the lip

Improvements to consider:
- Overall endurance, especially for the left arm
- Kneebar position and making the first move less snatchy
- Moving faster, especially finding the 2nd move thumb-catch faster
- Really digging directionally with the right toe for the 5th move
- Relax arms and shoulders before swinging heel up, really kick back to get a full swing on the leg
- Foot-walk to place right foot for heel swing, or keeping the left heel for the foot-walk, or finding better toe-hook for the foot-walk
- Planning out when to breathe

### Session 5 - October 17, 2025

Much colder, rock felt much sharper. Right heel for 3rd move felt much glassier and didn't stick.
Came in with bad sleep, couldn't do a lot of moves in a row, and felt like my body wasn't moving correctly. 
Didn't make any new significant new links, as most of my goals involved going through the 3rd move.

3rd move, in case it keeps feeling glassy, need to try:
- Cleaning with a vinegar dilution
- Changing shoes - shoe's heel is getting a little smoother and worn down and a new heel cup might feel better
- Intentionally palm squeeze with left hand against the heel pressure

### Session 4 - October 10, 2025

Some good progress, but a bit frustrated to never stick the 5th move from the start. 
This would represent doing all of the physical part of the climbing, and from there, sending would require mostly execution and power endurance.

Did stick the 5th move once, but right foot floated off and dabbed on the pads.
- More learning to be done in terms of pulling well with the right toe.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 3 through getting ready for the top sequence
- From start through move 5 (ish)

### Session 3 - October 3rd, 2025

Hot session with slick conditions. No significant progress, but tried and decided on various foot positions:
- Decided on heel positions after the 5th move, as well as right foot positions to oppose the heels.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 5 to the lip
- Lip encounter to the top

### Session 2 - September 28th, 2025

Did the 3rd move! Psyched on the climb again.

#### Some key beta for the 3rd move:
- Instinct laces were the best heels.
- 3 finger drag with a thumb-catch for the left hand.
- Left wrist sits to the right side of the bump.
- Left knee points slightly towards the target right hand.
- Left hand only pulls enough to set the heel.
- The right heel pulls as hard as possible.

#### Significant links:
- Moves 3-5
- Start through move 3
- Lip encounter to the topout (poor beta, needed refining)

### Session 1 - 2024

Quickly did all the moves, except for the third. The 5th move took several tries, but did it a few times that session.

Spent probably 2+ hours on just the third move, and never stuck it. Could never decide how exactly to hold the left hand slot.
