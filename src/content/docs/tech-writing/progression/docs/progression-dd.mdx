## Abstract
There is a well-known saying in the sphere of physical training: “what gets measured, gets managed”. To that end, trying to improve sports performance requires accurate measurements methods. Among the many ecosystems that exist for tracking sports performance, none are currently available that fit the unique needs for rock climbing.

Progression is an attempt to fill that gap, with a focus on the discipline of outdoor bouldering.

Progression also exists as a personal development project. With this project, I hope to build skills in technical writing, UI/UX writing, and software development, all while building an application I will use in my daily life.

## Terms and Definitions
For clarity, we define here terms and concepts related to sports performance. These are basic to exercise, and thus are basic to how Progression is structured.

- **Exercise**: A single movement. Multiple exercises make up a single session.
- **Session**: A single bout of training. Typically an hour or several hours long. It is possible for multiple sessions to be scheduled in a single day. 
*Please note this definition is distinct from the notion of a user ‘session’ related to authentication upon entering an app.*
- **Block**: A cycle of training with a defined focus. Rather than seeking to improve all aspects of sports performance at once, a block of training will typically consist of 3-6 weeks where a specific aspect will be the target to improve. For example, a strength block will focus on improving strength, and during this block, other aspects such as endurance will only be worked on at a maintenance level.
- **Isometric**: In exercise physiology, an isometric exercise is one in which the joint angles involved do not move, and thus the muscles do not shorten. The muscles do contract, but statically. A common example is the core plank.


## Climbing-Specific Challenges

Every sport brings unique challenges to participants. In descending order of scope, the following are the most unique aspects of outdoor bouldering, when compared with other sports:

<Steps>
1. Seasonality:
Many sports have an on season and an off season, but rock climbing is unique in that the schedule is made following the weather, and not due to anything man-made. It is much less predictable when a climber is expected to perform.
Because there is no defined season for climbing, this also means climbing can be performed year-round. Extending peak performance is also a key component.

2. Indeterminate session length:
Unlike most competitive sports, for example basketball, outdoor bouldering has no defined time limit. Because a basketball game always consists of four 12-minute quarters, the length of a game is predictable. For outdoor climbing, the goal is to complete the climb, and thus could be finished in as little as a few minutes, or could be an all-day affair. Increasing fitness will increase the effective length of sessions, also increasing the amount of opportunities for successful completion of a climb.

3. Isometric loading:
When gripping climbing holds, fingers remain flexed in an isometric position and do not undergo any range of motion. Even while moving in between positions, oftentimes the climber finds the best position to perch for three of their limbs while moving just one. Isometric training is thus much more important for climbing compared to other sports.

4. Loading of small structures:
Climbing is a whole-body sport, but places more strain on the fingers than perhaps any other sport. The joints and connective tissue in the fingers and hands are small relative to the amount of load being put upon them, and thus climbing demands careful management of volume and intensity on these structures.
</Steps>

## Features

The Progression App hopes to achieve an ecosystem that allows a climber to accurately track and plan their climbing, providing a solution to the challenging variables listed above. The planned features include the following foundation:

<Steps>
1. Block Planning:
	A page with timelines to plan training sessions. The timeline charts will depict the varying frequency and volumes of training. Specific for climbing, the workout planning will come with options to specify ‘time-under-tension’, one of the primary measures for isometric training.

2. Workout Logging:
	A separate page to track individual training sessions. If a block has been planned, then the anticipated workout will be pre-filled. Exercises will be pulled from the master list of exercises.

3. History:
	A scrollable paginated catalogue of past workouts. A comment system will be implemented so that the user can insert details in hindsight, primarily intended to mark when injury occurred or a surprising performance period occurred, whether good or bad.

4. Exercise Template Management:
	A page with the complete list of exercise templates available. These will be the exercises that can be pulled to create new workouts in the Block Planning feature and the Workout Logging feature, and this feature will regulate that list. New exercises can be created here and outdated exercises may be deleted.
</Steps>

Another value of this careful tracking is in providing a profile before, during, and after performance periods. If the athlete improves, stagnates, or gets injured, there will be a profile of the training and efforts that led up to these breakpoints.
As stated before, solutions exist for tracking workouts, but by providing an ecosystem specifically designed to track climbing progress, we can more accurately determine what parts of the training efforts lead to success or not.

## User Flow

For convenience, user flows are shown below. They are a bit unwieldy in a document format, and for a larger, enterprise-level project, something like Confluence should be considered for better structuring and organization.

## Architecture

At first, Progression will utilize Supabase to provide the backend infrastructure. The goal is to provide easy testing and a quick start-up of the project. For the frontend, Progression will utilize React due to versatility and the myriad of available UI libraries.

![Figure 2.1](@assets/tech-writing/progression/fig2-1.png)
*Fig. 2.1 - Progression’s system architecture*

Once the frontend is finalized, Progression will build out its own backend using Django. This step is necessary due to the nature of Progression as a personal development project, and serves primarily as a learning exercise. For the backend, Python was chosen for its versatility, and Django as the framework to provide abstraction and scalability in the future.

## Component Structure

![Figure 3.1](@assets/tech-writing/progression/fig3-1.png)
*Fig. 3.1 - Progression component structure*

Progression’s main components will consist of an exercise management piece and a workout planning piece.
The Exercise Manager component is responsible for handling updates to the repository of exercises available on the Progression App. The Exercise Manager will be capable of CRUD operations for all exercises, and is also responsible for governing which exercises are available to the Workout Planner.
The Workout Planner is the main component in Progression. The Workout Planner will be responsible for the UI that enables the main functionalities of Progression: creating and storing workouts and workout templates.

![Figure 3.2](@assets/tech-writing/progression/fig3-2.png)
*Fig. 3.2 - In-depth of Workout Planner component*

Above is a more in-depth view on the Workout Planner component, which encapsulates the three core features of logging workouts, planning workout blocks, and reviewing workout histories. The figure above shows the information flow between these three pieces. UI for each will differ somewhat to provide the best experience. Workout Histories is only expected to read from the database, and will not have any functionality to change data. Block Planner and Workout Logging portions will function similarly, with the main difference being the presence of timestamps in the Workout Logging feature. Block Planner will also feature more scalable UI to support template creation.

## Hosting Options

Hosting options have not yet been fully explored. Currently, free options are being investigated. If Progression scales past a hobby-level app, pricing options will need to be further analyzed.

Frontend options:
- AWS
	- Pros: Ubiquitous
	- Cons: Relatively more difficult to implement
- Render.com
		- Pro: All-in-one solution
- Cons: Not quite as generous with free options
- Vercel:
	- Pros: Ease of use
	- Cons: Scalability concerns

Backend Options:
As Supabase uses Postgres, it is planned to migrate to a Postgres database once the Django backend is finalized.
- AWS
	- Pros: Ubiquitous, Postgres option
	- Cons: Relatively more difficult to implement
- Render.com
	- Pros: All-in-one solution
	- Cons: Not quite as generous with free options
- CockroachDB
	- Pros: Free hobby-level tier, Postgres, Built on top of AWS
	- Cons: AWS experience has more industry applications
- Staying on Supabase
	- Pros: No migration
	- Cons: Relatively limited scalability

Frontrunner options currently are Vercel for the web app and AWS for the database. AWS has a Postgres option, enables future scalability, and is the most ubiquitous cloud platform available. Thus, AWS has the most upside as a learning project.

## Future Development
Currently, Progression is only being developed as a web app, but for the Workout Logging feature, a mobile app may have the best use case. If there is a gap in the user experience due to lack of a mobile app, then we will explore a mobile component for Progression.

## API Introduction
Progression will utilize a RESTful API, with standard HTTP codes and authentication. A more detailed API reference is currently in-progress.
