While there are a myriad of ecosystems for workout tracking, none exactly fit the needs for rock climbing. 
Climbing is not very commercialized while also having sport-specific demands, and thus utilizing a generic workout tracking solution proved frustrating.

Melding my hobby and my career interests, I wanted to create an app that would prove useful in my hobby of climbing. Progression exists with a threefold goal:
- A vehicle for project-based learning
- An inspiration to create sample documentation for a tech writing portfolio
- Filling the gap of a workout tracker designed for my hobby's specific needs
