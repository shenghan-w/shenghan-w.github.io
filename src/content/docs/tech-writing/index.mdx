I have five years of experience working as a specification engineer in the automotive industry, primarily doing some form or other of technical writing. My projects included the creation of:

- Specification docs, API docs, and development docs for a technical audience
- Flowcharts, diagrams, and user docs for a lay audience
- Suites of test cases and testing reports
- Documentation connecting cross-functional requirements between teams with language and cultural barriers

As all my previous experience was proprietary, this is a collection and portfolio of my personal tech writing, currently hosting the documentation for a WIP app.
